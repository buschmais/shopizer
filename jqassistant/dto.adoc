=== Data Transfer Object

This section describes the concept of Data Transfer Objects (DTO).
A DTO is a POJO containing fields and accessor methods and used for exchanging information.
The rationale is to avoid direct coupling between implementations of independent building blocks (e.g. bounded contexts).
